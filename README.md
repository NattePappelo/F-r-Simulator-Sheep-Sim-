# FÃ¥r Simulator (Sheep Sim)
This is a very bad game I made when I was bored, and it has become a meme among my friends.


1.0 has been lost to time.

as far as i know there is no big differens between 1.1 and 1.0

1.2 was the first multiligual with .py language packs. But you needed to modify main.py to add or remove languagepacks.

1.3 added config.txt and the language packs are in .json instead. (my plan is to maybe change the programing language in the future so then its good that it isnt in .py). Also added pirate speak and moved some fases to the language packs that was peviosly in main.py. This was the first version with an Emerick edition.

1.4 Added custom errors and refined the config.txt

### If you need help with installing/running the game see the wiki.

There is a online version. Its not the best of the versions and its only in swedish. You find it at https://nattepappelo.github.io/farsim/
